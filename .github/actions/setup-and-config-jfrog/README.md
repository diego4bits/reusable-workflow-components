# üê∏ Setup JFrog CLI (Access Token)

A composite GitHub Action that installs **JFrog CLI** and authenticates it with a long-lived or CI-scoped *access token*.
Optionally configures Maven to resolve dependencies from the specified Artifactory repositories.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **One-shot login** ‚Äì `jfrog setup-jfrog-cli@v4` plus token injection.
* **Maven‚Äêready** ‚Äì Generates a `.m2/settings.xml` that points `releases` and `snapshots` to Artifactory.
* **Bolt-on** ‚Äì Designed to be called right before any build; no persistent state.
* **Air-gapped-friendly** ‚Äì Works with a mirrored Artifactory instance (see [Source 5]()).

## üöÄ Usage

```yaml
name: Build & Upload

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 1Ô∏è‚É£  JDK is required because we invoke Maven later
      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: your-org/setup-jdk@v1
        with:
          java-version: 17

      # 2Ô∏è‚É£  Authenticate to Artifactory + configure Maven
      - name: Set up JFrog CLI
        uses: your-org/setup-jfrog-cli-token@v1
        with:
          jf-url: ${{ vars.JF_URL }}
          jf-access-token: ${{ secrets.JF_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          jf-repo-resolve-releases: libs-release               # optional
          jf-repo-resolve-snapshots: libs-snapshot             # optional

      # 3Ô∏è‚É£  Example build that consumes the configuration
      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn -B verify

      # 4Ô∏è‚É£  Optional: use JFrog CLI commands
      - name: Ping Artifactory

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Notes

1. **JDK prerequisite**
   Maven needs a Java runtime; install it first (see example).

2. **Environment variables**
   `setup-jfrog-cli@v4` reads `JF_URL` and `JF_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
   These are supplied via `env` in the composite action‚Äôs first step.

3. **Custom build tools**
   If you build with Gradle, sbt, or npm, simply ignore the Maven step or fork the action to add your own CLI configuration command.

4. **Self-hosted / air-gapped runners**
   Mirror the [JFrog releases registry]() inside your network and set `JFROG_CLI_OFFER_CONFIG=false` to avoid outbound calls.

---

## üíª Development

* **Tech stack:** YAML + Bash only (composite action).
* **Tests:** Use [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) with a dummy workflow.
* **Versioning:** Semantic tags (`v1`, `v1.1.0`, ‚Ä¶) so consumers can pin.
